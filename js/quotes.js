//Create an array of JavaScript objects to hold the data for your quotes. Name the array quotes. The quotes array should be accessible in the global scope.

/*
Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:
A quote property which contains a string: the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.
A source property which contains a string identifying the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb.‚Äù
An optional citation property which contains a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech or publication. For example, "Famous Anonymous Jokes." If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.
An optional year property which contains a number identifying the date of the quote. For example, 1997. If there is no known date, then do not include this property on the object.
